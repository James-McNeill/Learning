-- Summarizing and aggregating numeric data
-- You'll build on functions like min and max to summarize numeric data in new ways. 
-- Add average, variance, correlation, and percentile functions to your toolkit, and learn how to truncate and round numeric values too. 
-- Build complex queries and save your results by creating temporary tables.

-- A. Numeric data types and summary functions
-- 1. Division
-- Select average revenue per employee by sector
SELECT sector, 
       avg(revenues/employees::numeric) AS avg_rev_employee
  FROM fortune500
 GROUP BY sector
 -- Use the column alias to order the results
 ORDER BY avg_rev_employee;
 
-- 2. Explore with division
-- Divide unanswered_count by question_count
SELECT unanswered_count/question_count::numeric AS computed_pct, 
       -- What are you comparing the above quantity to?
       unanswered_pct
  FROM stackoverflow
 -- Select rows where question_count is not 0
 WHERE question_count > 0
 LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Summarize numeric columns
-- Select sector and summary measures of fortune500 profits
SELECT sector,
       min(profits),
       avg(profits),
       max(profits),
       stddev(profits)
  FROM fortune500
 -- What to group by?
 GROUP BY sector
 -- Order by the average profits
 ORDER BY avg;
 
-- 4. Summarize group statistics
-- Compute standard deviation of maximum values
SELECT stddev(maxval),
	   -- min
       min(maxval),
       -- max
       max(maxval),
       -- avg
       avg(maxval)
  -- Subquery to compute max of question_count by tag
  FROM (SELECT max(question_count) AS maxval
          FROM stackoverflow
         -- Compute max by...
         GROUP BY tag) AS max_results; -- alias for subquery
-- B. Explorting distributions
-- 1. Truncate
-- Truncate employees. Removes the values from the overall number e.g. 13456, trunc(value, -3) result: 13000
SELECT trunc(employees, -4) AS employee_bin,
       -- Count number of companies with each truncated value
       count(*)
  FROM fortune500
 -- Limit to which companies?
 WHERE employees < 100000
 -- Use alias to group
 GROUP BY employee_bin
 -- Use alias to order
 ORDER BY employee_bin;
 
--  2. Generate a series
-- generate_series(from, to, step)
-- Bins created in Step 2
WITH bins AS (
      SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower,
             generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper),
     -- Subset stackoverflow to just tag dropbox (Step 1)
     dropbox AS (
      SELECT question_count 
        FROM stackoverflow
       WHERE tag='dropbox') 
-- Select columns for result
-- What column are you counting to summarize?
SELECT lower, upper, count(question_count) 
  FROM bins  -- Created above
       -- Join to dropbox (created above), 
       -- keeping all rows from the bins table in the join
       LEFT JOIN dropbox
       -- Compare question_count to lower and upper
         ON question_count >= lower 
        AND question_count < upper
 -- Group by lower and upper to count values in each bin
 GROUP BY lower, upper
 -- Order by lower to put bins in order
 ORDER BY lower;
