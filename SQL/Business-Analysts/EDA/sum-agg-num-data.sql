-- Summarizing and aggregating numeric data
-- You'll build on functions like min and max to summarize numeric data in new ways. 
-- Add average, variance, correlation, and percentile functions to your toolkit, and learn how to truncate and round numeric values too. 
-- Build complex queries and save your results by creating temporary tables.

-- A. Numeric data types and summary functions
-- 1. Division
-- Select average revenue per employee by sector
SELECT sector, 
       avg(revenues/employees::numeric) AS avg_rev_employee
  FROM fortune500
 GROUP BY sector
 -- Use the column alias to order the results
 ORDER BY avg_rev_employee;
 
-- 2. Explore with division
-- Divide unanswered_count by question_count
SELECT unanswered_count/question_count::numeric AS computed_pct, 
       -- What are you comparing the above quantity to?
       unanswered_pct
  FROM stackoverflow
 -- Select rows where question_count is not 0
 WHERE question_count > 0
 LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Summarize numeric columns
-- Select sector and summary measures of fortune500 profits
SELECT sector,
       min(profits),
       avg(profits),
       max(profits),
       stddev(profits)
  FROM fortune500
 -- What to group by?
 GROUP BY sector
 -- Order by the average profits
 ORDER BY avg;
 
-- 4. Summarize group statistics
-- Compute standard deviation of maximum values
SELECT stddev(maxval),
	   -- min
       min(maxval),
       -- max
       max(maxval),
       -- avg
       avg(maxval)
  -- Subquery to compute max of question_count by tag
  FROM (SELECT max(question_count) AS maxval
          FROM stackoverflow
         -- Compute max by...
         GROUP BY tag) AS max_results; -- alias for subquery
