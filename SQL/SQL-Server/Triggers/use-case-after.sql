-- Use cases for AFTER DML

-- 1. Create a trigger to keep row history. Keep track of any adjustments to a table due to INSERT / UPDATE statements
CREATE TRIGGER CopyCustomersToHistory
ON Customers
-- Fire the trigger for new and updated rows
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE
AS
	INSERT INTO CustomersHistory (CustomerID, Customer, ContractID, ContractDate, Address, PhoneNo, Email, ChangeDate)
	SELECT CustomerID, Customer, ContractID, ContractDate, Address, PhoneNo, Email, GETDATE()
    -- Get info from the special table that keeps new rows
    FROM inserted;

-- 2. Add a trigger that tracks table changes
CREATE TRIGGER OrdersAudit
ON Orders
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS
	DECLARE @Insert BIT = 0;
	DECLARE @Delete BIT = 0;
	IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted) SET @Insert = 1;
	IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted) SET @Delete = 1;
	INSERT INTO TablesAudit (TableName, EventType, UserAccount, EventDate)
	SELECT 'Orders' AS TableName
	       ,CASE WHEN @Insert = 1 AND @Delete = 0 THEN 'INSERT'
				 WHEN @Insert = 1 AND @Delete = 1 THEN 'UPDATE'
				 WHEN @Insert = 0 AND @Delete = 1 THEN 'DELETE'
				 END AS Event
		   ,ORIGINAL_LOGIN() AS UserAccount
		   ,GETDATE() AS EventDate;
