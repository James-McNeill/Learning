-- Working with sub-queries

-- 1. Uncorrelated sub-query
SELECT UNStatisticalRegion,
       CountryName 
FROM Nations
WHERE Code2 -- Country code for outer query 
         IN (SELECT Country -- Country code for sub-query
             FROM Earthquakes
             WHERE Depth >= 400 ) -- Depth filter
ORDER BY UNStatisticalRegion;

-- 2. Correlated sub-query
SELECT UNContinentRegion,
       CountryName, 
        (SELECT AVG(Magnitude) -- Add average magnitude
        FROM Earthquakes e 
         	  -- Add country code reference
        WHERE n.Code2 = e.Country) AS AverageMagnitude 
FROM Nations n
ORDER BY UNContinentRegion DESC, 
         AverageMagnitude DESC;

-- 3. Sub-query Vs INNER JOIN
SELECT
	n.CountryName,
	 (SELECT MAX(c.Pop2017) -- Add 2017 population column
	 FROM Cities AS c 
                       -- Outer query country code column
	 WHERE c.CountryCode = n.Code2) AS BiggestCity
FROM Nations AS n; -- Outer query table

-- Using an INNER JOIN can help with query performance
SELECT n.CountryName, 
       c.BiggestCity 
FROM Nations AS n
INNER JOIN -- Join the Nations table and sub-query
    (SELECT CountryCode, 
     MAX(Pop2017) AS BiggestCity 
     FROM Cities
     GROUP BY CountryCode) AS c
ON n.Code2 = c.CountryCode; -- Add the joining columns
