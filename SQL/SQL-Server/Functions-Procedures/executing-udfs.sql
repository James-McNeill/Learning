-- The UDF that was created will be stored in the schema that was assigned to it. In these
-- examples the dbo schema has been used. However if a value is not provided for the schema
-- then the users default schema will be used unless a specific value was assigned.

-- 1. Execute the UDF within a SELECT statement
-- Create @BeginDate
DECLARE @BeginDate AS date = '3/1/2018'
-- Create @EndDate
DECLARE @EndDate AS date = '3/10/2018' 
SELECT
  -- Select @BeginDate
  @BeginDate AS BeginDate,
  -- Select @EndDate
  @EndDate AS EndDate,
  -- Execute SumRideHrsDateRange()
  dbo.SumRideHrsDateRange(@BeginDate, @EndDate) AS TotalRideHrs

-- 2. Use the EXEC keyword to assign a value to the declared variable
-- Create @RideHrs
DECLARE @RideHrs AS numeric
-- Execute SumRideHrsSingleDay function and store the result in @RideHrs
EXEC @RideHrs = dbo.SumRideHrsSingleDay @DateParm = '3/5/2018' 
SELECT 
  'Total Ride Hours for 3/5/2018:', 
  @RideHrs
