# Since Git saves all the changes you've made to your files, you can use it to undo those changes. This chapter shows you several ways to do that.

# How can I commit changes selectively?
You don't have to put all of the changes you have made recently into the staging area at once. For example, suppose you are 
adding a feature to analysis.R and spot a bug in cleanup.R. After you have fixed it, you want to save your work. Since the changes to cleanup.R 
aren't directly related to the work you're doing in analysis.R, you should save your work in two separate commits.

The syntax for staging a single file is git add path/to/file.

If you make a mistake and accidentally stage a file you shouldn't have, you can unstage the additions with git reset HEAD and try again.

# How do I re-stage files?

People often save their work every few minutes when they're using a desktop text editor. Similarly, it's common to use git add periodically to save 
the most recent changes to a file to the staging area. This is particularly useful when the changes are experimental and you might want to undo them 
without cluttering up the repository's history.

# How can I undo changes to unstaged files?
Suppose you have made changes to a file, then decide you want to undo them. Your text editor may be able to do this, but a more reliable way is to 
let Git do the work. The command:

git checkout -- filename
will discard the changes that have not yet been staged. (The double dash -- must be there to separate the git checkout command from the names of the 
file or files you want to recover.)

Use this command carefully: once you discard changes in this way, they are gone forever.

# How can I undo changes to staged files?
At the start of this chapter you saw that git reset will unstage files that you previously staged using git add. By combining git reset with git checkout, 
you can undo changes to a file that you staged changes to. The syntax is as follows.

git reset HEAD path/to/file
git checkout -- path/to/file
(You may be wondering why there are two commands for re-setting changes. The answer is that unstaging a file and undoing changes are both special 
cases of more powerful Git operations that you have not yet seen.)

# How do I restore an old version of a file?
You previously saw how to use git checkout to undo the changes that you made since the last commit. This command can also be used to go back even further 
into a file's history and restore versions of that file from a commit. In this way, you can think of committing as saving your work, and checking out as 
loading that saved version.

git checkout 2242bd report.txt would replace the current version of report.txt with the version that was committed on October 16. Notice that this is 
the same syntax that you used to undo the unstaged changes, except -- has been replaced by a hash.

One more thing: there's another feature of git log that will come in handy here. Passing - followed by a number restricts the output to that many commits. 
For example, git log -3 report.txt shows you the last three commits involving report.txt.

# How can I undo all of the changes I have made?
So far, you have seen how to undo changes to a single file at a time using git reset HEAD path/to/file. You will sometimes want to undo changes to many files.

One way to do this is to give git reset a directory. For example, git reset HEAD data will unstage any files from the data directory. Even better, if you don't 
provide any files or directories, it will unstage everything. Even even better, HEAD is the default commit to unstage, so you can simply write git reset to 
unstage everything.

Similarly git checkout -- data will then restore the files in the data directory to their previous state. You can't leave the file argument completely blank, 
but recall from Introduction to Shell for Data Science that you can refer to the current directory as .. So git checkout -- . will revert all files in the 
current directory.
