# git status
When you are using Git, you will frequently want to check the status of your repository. To do this, run the command git status, 
which displays a list of the files that have been modified since the last time changes were saved

# understand what has been changed in a repository since last review
git diff                # shows all the changes made
git diff filename       # filename changes
git diff directory      # directory changes

# what is a diff
A diff is a formatted display of the differences between two sets of files.
RStudio can display more readable side-by-side displays of the changes.

git diff data/northern.csv

Output displayed shows the changes made to the file. Lines removed are prefixed with - and lines added are prefixed with +
