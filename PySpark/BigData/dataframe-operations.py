# Performing operations on the DataFrame

# 1. Initial EDA
# Print the first 10 observations 
people_df.show(10)

# Count the number of rows 
print("There are {} rows in the people_df DataFrame.".format(people_df.count()))

# Count the number of columns and their names
print("There are {} columns in the people_df DataFrame and their names are {}".format(len(people_df.columns), people_df.columns))

# 2. Subsetting and cleaning
# Select name, sex and date of birth columns
people_df_sub = people_df.select('name', 'sex', 'date of birth')

# Print the first 10 observations from people_df_sub
people_df_sub.show(10)

# Remove duplicate entries from people_df_sub
people_df_sub_nodup = people_df_sub.dropDuplicates()

# Count the number of rows
print("There were {} rows before removing duplicates, and {} rows after removing duplicates".format(people_df_sub.count(), people_df_sub_nodup.count()))
