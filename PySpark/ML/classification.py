# Classification
# Building two types of classification model: Decision Trees and Logistic Regression

# A. Data Preparation
# 1. Removing columns and rows
# Remove the 'flight' column
flights_drop_column = flights.drop('flight')

# Number of records with missing 'delay' values
flights_drop_column.filter('delay IS NULL').count()

# Remove records with missing 'delay' values
flights_valid_delay = flights_drop_column.filter('delay IS NOT NULL')

# Remove records with missing values in any column and get the number of remaining rows
flights_none_missing = flights_valid_delay.dropna()
print(flights_none_missing.count())

# 2. Column manipulation
