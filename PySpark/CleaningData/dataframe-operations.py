# Filtering with the dataframe

# Import module
import pyspark.sql.functions as F

# 1. Filtering column content
# Show the distinct VOTER_NAME entries
voter_df.select('VOTER_NAME').distinct().show(40, truncate=False)

# Filter voter_df where the VOTER_NAME is 1-20 characters in length
voter_df = voter_df.filter('length(VOTER_NAME) > 0 and length(VOTER_NAME) < 20')

# Filter out voter_df where the VOTER_NAME contains an underscore
voter_df = voter_df.filter(~ F.col('VOTER_NAME').contains('_'))

# Show the distinct VOTER_NAME entries again
voter_df.select('VOTER_NAME').distinct().show(40, truncate=False)

# 2. Modifying dataframe columns
# Add a new column called splits separated on whitespace
voter_df = voter_df.withColumn('splits', F.split(voter_df.VOTER_NAME, '\s+'))

# Create a new column called first_name based on the first item in splits
voter_df = voter_df.withColumn('first_name', voter_df.splits.getItem(0))

# Get the last entry of the splits list and create a column called last_name
voter_df = voter_df.withColumn('last_name', voter_df.splits.getItem(F.size('splits') - 1))

# Drop the splits column
voter_df = voter_df.drop('splits')

# Show the voter_df DataFrame
voter_df.show()

# 3. when() example
# Add a column to voter_df for any voter with the title **Councilmember**
voter_df = voter_df.withColumn('random_val',
                               F.when(voter_df.TITLE == 'Councilmember', F.rand()))

# Show some of the DataFrame rows, noting whether the when clause worked
voter_df.show()
