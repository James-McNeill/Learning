# Showing uncertainty
# Uncertainty occurs everywhere in data science, but it's frequently left out of visualizations where it should be included. 
# Here, we review what a confidence interval is and how to visualize them for both single estimates and continuous functions. 
# Additionally, we discuss the bootstrap resampling technique for assessing uncertainty and how to visualize it properly

# A. Point estimate intervals
# 1. Basic confidence intervals
