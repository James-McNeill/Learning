# Bootstrap confidence intervals

'''
To "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" is a classic idiom meaning that you achieve a difficult task by yourself with 
no help at all. In statistical inference, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition 
an infinite number of times. This task is impossible, but can we use only the data we actually have to get close to the 
same result as an infinitude of experiments? The answer is yes! The technique to do it is aptly called bootstrapping. 
This chapter will introduce you to this extraordinarily powerful tool.
