# Regression model accuracy metrics

# 1. Mean Absolute Error
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Manually calculate the MAE
n = len(predictions)
mae_one = sum(abs(y_test - predictions)) / n
print('With a manual calculation, the error is {}'.format(mae_one))

# Use scikit-learn to calculate the MAE
mae_two = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print('Using scikit-lean, the error is {}'.format(mae_two))

# 2. Mean Squared Error - large errors (poorer predictions) will have more of an impact. 
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

n = len(predictions)
# Finish the manual calculation of the MSE
mse_one = sum((y_test - predictions)**2) / n
print('With a manual calculation, the error is {}'.format(mse_one))

# Use the scikit-learn function to calculate MSE
mse_two = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print('Using scikit-lean, the error is {}'.format(mse_two))

# 3. Example to compare the mae by NBA conference
# Find the East conference teams
east_teams = labels == "E"

# Create arrays for the true and predicted values
true_east = y_test[east_teams]
preds_east = predictions[east_teams]

# Print the accuracy metrics
print('The MAE for East teams is {}'.format(
    mae(true_east, preds_east)))

# Print the West accuracy - shows the accuracy of the game predictions. Experts picked game wins better for the West
# so this showed a lower MAE (predicted games win difference to actual)
print('The MAE for West conference is {}'.format(west_error))
