# Term frequency-inverse document frequency (Tf-Idf)
# Tf-idf has the effect of reducing the value of common words, while increasing the weight of words that do not occur in many documents

# Import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Instantiate TfidfVectorizer
tv = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=100, stop_words='english')

# Fit the vectroizer and transform the data
tv_transformed = tv.fit_transform(speech_df['text_clean'])

# Create a DataFrame with these features
tv_df = pd.DataFrame(tv_transformed.toarray(), 
                     columns=tv.get_feature_names()).add_prefix('TFIDF_')
print(tv_df.head())
