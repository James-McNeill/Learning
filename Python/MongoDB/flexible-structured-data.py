# Introduction to using MongoDB

# A MongoDB database can consist of several collections. Collections, in turn, consist of documents, which store the data.
# Recall that you can access databases by name as attributes of the client, like client.my_database (a connected client is 
# already provided to you as client). Similarly, collections can be accessed by name as attributes of databases (my_database.my_collection).
