# Optimizing a neural network with backward propagation

# A. The need for optimization
# 1. Coding how weight changes affect accuracy
# The data point you will make a prediction for
input_data = np.array([0, 3])

# Sample weights
weights_0 = {'node_0': [2, 1],
             'node_1': [1, 2],
             'output': [1, 1]
            }

# The actual target value, used to calculate the error
target_actual = 3

# Make prediction using original weights
model_output_0 = predict_with_network(input_data, weights_0)

# Calculate error: error_0
error_0 = model_output_0 - target_actual

# Create weights that cause the network to make perfect prediction (3): weights_1
weights_1 = {'node_0': [2, 1],
             'node_1': [1, 0],
             'output': [1, 1]
            }

# Make prediction using new weights: model_output_1
model_output_1 = predict_with_network(input_data, weights_1)

# Calculate error: error_1
error_1 = model_output_1 - target_actual

# Print error_0 and error_1
print(error_0)
print(error_1)

# 2. Scaling up to multiple data points
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Create model_output_0 
model_output_0 = []
# Create model_output_1
model_output_1 = []

# Loop over input_data
for row in input_data:
    # Append prediction to model_output_0
    model_output_0.append(predict_with_network(row, weights_0))
    
    # Append prediction to model_output_1
    model_output_1.append(predict_with_network(row, weights_1))

# Calculate the mean squared error for model_output_0: mse_0
mse_0 = mean_squared_error(target_actuals, model_output_0)

# Calculate the mean squared error for model_output_1: mse_1
mse_1 = mean_squared_error(target_actuals, model_output_1)

# Print mse_0 and mse_1
print("Mean squared error with weights_0: %f" %mse_0)
print("Mean squared error with weights_1: %f" %mse_1)

# B. Gradient Descent
# 1. Calculating slopes
# Calculate the predictions: preds
preds = (weights * input_data).sum()

# Calculate the error: error
error = preds - target

# Calculate the slope: slope
slope = input_data * error * 2

# Print the slope
print(slope)

# 2. Improving model weights
# learning_rate: by applying a smaller learning rate this means that the update to the model will be a small step forward. Then a model
# review of the new error can take place. If there is an improvement in the error prediction then this model change can be seen as an improvement. 
# However, if we had taken a larger step forward using a larger learning rate and this resulted in the error increasing, then the model would have
# moved in the wrong direction and a larger correction would be required. Therefore, care is required when making model improvements

# Set the learning rate: learning_rate
learning_rate = 0.01

# Calculate the predictions: preds
preds = (weights * input_data).sum()

# Calculate the error: error
error = preds - target

# Calculate the slope: slope
slope = 2 * input_data * error

# Update the weights: weights_updated
weights_updated = weights - (learning_rate * slope)

# Get updated predictions: preds_updated
preds_updated = (weights_updated * input_data).sum()

# Calculate updated error: error_updated
error_updated = preds_updated - target

# Print the original error
print(error)

# Print the updated error
print(error_updated)
