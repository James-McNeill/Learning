# Neural networks

# A. Dense layers
# 1. Linear algebra of dense layers
# Create the first feature
bias1 = Variable(1.0)
weights1 = Variable(ones((3, 2)))
product1 = matmul(borrower_features, weights1)
dense1 = keras.activations.sigmoid(product1 + bias1)

# Initialize bias2 and weights2
bias2 = Variable(1.0)
weights2 = Variable(ones((2, 1)))

# Perform matrix multiplication of dense1 and weights2
product2 = matmul(dense1, weights2)

# Apply activation to product2 + bias2 and print the prediction
prediction = keras.activations.sigmoid(product2 + bias2)
print('\n prediction: {}'.format(prediction.numpy()[0,0]))
print('\n actual: 1')

# 2. The low-level approach with multiple examples
# Compute the product of borrower_features and weights1
products1 = matmul(borrower_features, weights1)

# Apply a sigmoid activation function to products1 + bias1
dense1 = keras.activations.sigmoid(products1 + bias1)

# Print the shapes of borrower_features, weights1, bias1, and dense1
print('\n shape of borrower_features: ', borrower_features.shape)
print('\n shape of weights1: ', weights1.shape)
print('\n shape of bias1: ', bias1.shape)
print('\n shape of dense1: ', dense1.shape)

# 3. Using the dense layer operation
# borrower_features: contained 10 features
# Each layer then has to be built on top of each other e.g. 10 > 7 > 3 > 1
# Define the first dense layer
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(7, activation='sigmoid')(borrower_features)

# Define a dense layer with 3 output nodes
dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(3, activation="sigmoid")(dense1)

# Define a dense layer with 1 output node
predictions = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")(dense2)

# Print the shapes of dense1, dense2, and predictions
print('\n shape of dense1: ', dense1.shape)
print('\n shape of dense2: ', dense2.shape)
print('\n shape of predictions: ', predictions.shape)
