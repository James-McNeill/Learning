# Introduction to TensorFlow

# A. Constants and Variables
# 1. Constants. Converting a numpy array containing credit card data to a TensorFlow constant
# Import constant from TensorFlow
from tensorflow import constant

# Convert the credit_numpy array into a tensorflow constant
credit_constant = constant(credit_numpy)

# Print constant datatype
print('\n The datatype is:', credit_constant.dtype)

# Print constant shape
print('\n The shape is:', credit_constant.shape)

# 2. Variables.
# Unlike a constant a variables value can be updated. This will be useful when working with parameter values that change over time
# Note that the Variable sub-module has been imported from TensorFlow already
# Define the 1-dimensional variable A1
A1 = Variable([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Print the variable A1
print('\n A1: ', A1)

# Convert A1 to a numpy array and assign it to B1
B1 = A1.numpy()

# Print B1
print('\n B1: ', B1)

# B. Basic operations
# 1. Performing element-wise multiplication
# Note that the sub-modules have been imported: multiply(), constant() and ones_like()
# Define tensors A1 and A23 as constants
A1 = constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
A23 = constant([[1, 2, 3], [1, 6, 4]])

# Define B1 and B23 to have the correct shape
B1 = ones_like(4,)
B23 = ones_like(2,3)

# Perform element-wise multiplication
C1 = multiply(A1, B1)
C23 = multiply(A23, B23)

# Print the tensors C1 and C23
print('\n C1: {}'.format(C1.numpy()))
print('\n C23: {}'.format(C23.numpy()))

# 2. Making predictions with matrix multiplication
# Define features, params, and bill as constants
features = constant([[2, 24], [2, 26], [2, 57], [1, 37]])
params = constant([[1000], [150]])
bill = constant([[3913], [2682], [8617], [64400]])

# Compute billpred using features and params
billpred = matmul(features, params)

# Compute and print the error
error = bill - billpred
print(error.numpy())

# C. Advanced operations
# 1. Reshape tensors. Working with two images (grayscale and color)
# Reshape the grayscale image tensor into a vector
gray_vector = reshape(gray_tensor, (784, 1))

# Reshape the color image tensor into a vector
color_vector = reshape(color_tensor, (2352, 1))
