# Linear models within TensorFlow
# Working to predict house price's

# A. Input data
# 1. Load data
# Import pandas under the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Assign the path to a string variable named data_path
data_path = 'kc_house_data.csv'

# Load the dataset as a dataframe named housing
housing = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Print the price column of housing
print(housing['price'])

# 2. Setting the data type
# Import numpy and tensorflow with their standard aliases
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Use a numpy array to define price as a 32-bit float
price = np.array(housing['price'], np.float32)

# Define waterfront as a Boolean using cast
waterfront = tf.cast(housing['waterfront'], tf.bool)

# Print price and waterfront
print(price)
print(waterfront)
