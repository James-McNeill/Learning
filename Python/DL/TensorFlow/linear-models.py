# Linear models within TensorFlow
# Working to predict house price's

# A. Input data
# 1. Load data
# Import pandas under the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Assign the path to a string variable named data_path
data_path = 'kc_house_data.csv'

# Load the dataset as a dataframe named housing
housing = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Print the price column of housing
print(housing['price'])

# 2. Setting the data type
# Import numpy and tensorflow with their standard aliases
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Use a numpy array to define price as a 32-bit float
price = np.array(housing['price'], np.float32)

# Define waterfront as a Boolean using cast
waterfront = tf.cast(housing['waterfront'], tf.bool)

# Print price and waterfront
print(price)
print(waterfront)

# B. Loss functions
# 1. Loss functions with TF
# Import the keras module from tensorflow
from tensorflow import keras

# Compute the mean squared error (mse) - penalizes large prediction deviations from actual values
loss = keras.losses.mse(price, predictions)

# Print the mean squared error (mse)
print(loss.numpy())

# Compute the mean absolute error (mae) - lower loss value returned as the algorithm doesn't penalize large losses as much
loss = keras.losses.mae(price, predictions)

# Print the mean absolute error (mae)
print(loss.numpy())

# 2. Modifying the loss function
# Initialize a variable named scalar
scalar = Variable(1.0, float32)

# Define the model
def model(scalar, features = features):
  	return scalar * features

# Define a loss function
def loss_function(scalar, features = features, targets = targets):
	# Compute the predicted values
	predictions = model(scalar, features)
    
	# Return the mean absolute error loss
	return keras.losses.mae(targets, predictions)

# Evaluate the loss function and print the loss
print(loss_function(scalar).numpy())

# C. Linear regression model
# 1. Set up a linear regression model
# Define a linear regression model
def linear_regression(intercept, slope, features = size_log):
	return intercept + slope * features

# Set loss_function() to take the variables as arguments
def loss_function(intercept, slope, features = size_log, targets = price_log):
	# Set the predicted values
	predictions = linear_regression(intercept, slope, features)
    
    # Return the mean squared error loss
	return keras.losses.mse(targets, predictions)

# Compute the loss for different slope and intercept values
print(loss_function(0.1, 0.1).numpy())
print(loss_function(0.1, 0.5).numpy())

# 2. Train a linear model. Univariate linear regression model
# Initialize an Adam optimizer
opt = keras.optimizers.Adam(0.5)

for j in range(100):
	# Apply minimize, pass the loss function, and supply the variables
	opt.minimize(lambda: loss_function(intercept, slope), var_list=[intercept, slope])

	# Print every 10th value of the loss
	if j % 10 == 0:
		print(loss_function(intercept, slope).numpy())

# Plot data and regression line
plot_results(intercept, slope)

# 3. Multiple linear regression
# Define the linear regression model
def linear_regression(params, feature1 = size_log, feature2 = bedrooms):
	return params[0] + feature1*params[1] + feature2*params[2]

# Define the loss function
def loss_function(params, targets = price_log, feature1 = size_log, feature2 = bedrooms):
	# Set the predicted values
	predictions = linear_regression(params, feature1, feature2)
  
	# Use the mean absolute error loss
	return keras.losses.mae(targets, predictions)

# Define the optimize operation
opt = keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Perform minimization and print trainable variables
for j in range(10):
	opt.minimize(lambda: loss_function(params), var_list=[params])
	print_results(params)
