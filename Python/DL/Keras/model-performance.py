# Model performance review

# A. Learning curves
# Reviewing the MNIST digit data images showing numbers from 0 to 9

# 1. Compile the model
# Instantiate a Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Input and hidden layer with input_shape, 16 neurons, and relu 
model.add(Dense(16, input_shape = (64,), activation = 'relu'))

# Output layer with 10 neurons (one per digit) and softmax
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile your model
model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

# Test if your model is well assembled by predicting before training
print(model.predict(X_train))

# 2. Check for model overfitting. Review the train and test loss curves
def plot_loss(loss,val_loss):
  plt.figure()
  plt.plot(loss)
  plt.plot(val_loss)
  plt.title('Model loss')
  plt.ylabel('Loss')
  plt.xlabel('Epoch')
  plt.legend(['Train', 'Test'], loc='upper right')
  plt.show()

# Train your model for 60 epochs, using X_test and y_test as validation data
h_callback = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 60, validation_data = (X_test, y_test), verbose=0)

# Extract from the h_callback object loss and val_loss to plot the learning curve
plot_loss(h_callback.history['loss'], h_callback.history['val_loss'])

# 3. Is more data required? Understanding if more training samples are required to improve model performance helps to train the model better
# Initial weights variable is extracted from the earlier model fit
initial_weights = model.get_weights()

# training_sizes: list of four training size values increasing over time
for size in training_sizes:
  	# Get a fraction of training data (we only care about the training data)
    X_train_frac, y_train_frac = X_train[:size], y_train[:size]

    # Reset the model to the initial weights and train it on the new training data fraction
    model.set_weights(initial_weights)
    model.fit(X_train_frac, y_train_frac, epochs = 50, callbacks = [early_stop])

    # Evaluate and store both: the training data fraction and the complete test set results
    train_accs.append(model.evaluate(X_train_frac, y_train_frac)[1])
    test_accs.append(model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)[1])
    
# Plot train vs test accuracies
plot_results(train_accs, test_accs)
