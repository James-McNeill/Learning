# Model performance review

# A. Learning curves
# Reviewing the MNIST digit data images showing numbers from 0 to 9

# 1. Compile the model
# Instantiate a Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Input and hidden layer with input_shape, 16 neurons, and relu 
model.add(Dense(16, input_shape = (64,), activation = 'relu'))

# Output layer with 10 neurons (one per digit) and softmax
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile your model
model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

# Test if your model is well assembled by predicting before training
print(model.predict(X_train))
