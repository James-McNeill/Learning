# Building deeper CNN
# The term deep learning comes from this idea of building multiple layers to learn

# For an image multiple elements in the image need to be reviewed. Therefore, each deep learning layer is aiming to understand a different
# element of the image. Similar to drawing an image, different sections require a different process to complete and are processed in a multi-layered
# order. This is now the aim of building a deeper network to help follow different aspects with each layer

# A. Going deeper
# 1. Creating a deep learning network
