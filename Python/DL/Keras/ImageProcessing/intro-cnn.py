# Image Processing With Neural Networks

# A. Intro to CNN
# Convolutional neural networks use the data that is represented in images to learn
# 1. Images as data: visualizations
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the image
data = plt.imread('bricks.png')

# Display the image
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()
