# Selecting columns and rows efficiently
# This chapter will give you an overview of why efficient code matters and selecting specific and random rows and columns efficiently.

# A. The need for efficient coding I
# 1. Measuring time I

# Extract the syntax for the functions that were used
import inspect
print(inspect.getsource(formula))

# Efficient formula function
def formula(N):
    return N*(N+1)*(2*N+1)/6

# Brute force function
def brute_force(N):
    res = 0
    UL = N+1
    for i in range(1,UL):
        res+=i^2
    return res

# Calculate the result of the problem using formula() and print the time required
N = 1000000
fm_start_time = time.time()
first_method = formula(N)
print("Time using formula: {} sec".format(time.time() - fm_start_time))

# Calculate the result of the problem using brute_force() and print the time required
sm_start_time = time.time()
second_method = brute_force(N)
print("Time using the brute force: {} sec".format(time.time() - sm_start_time))

# 2. Measuring time II
# Comparison between the list comprehension and for loop methods. If the analysis was performed on a much larger dataset
# then there could have been a larger time difference due to algorithm efficiency. Overall the list comprehension should
# provide the most efficient method 
# Store the time before the execution
start_time = time.time()

# Execute the operation
letlist = [wrd for wrd in words if wrd.startswith('b')]

# Store and print the difference between the start and the current time
total_time_lc = time.time() - start_time
print('Time using list comprehension: {} sec'.format(total_time_lc))

# Store the time before the execution
start_time = time.time()

# Execute the operation
letlist = []
for wrd in words:
    if wrd.startswith('b'):
        letlist.append(wrd)
        
# Print the difference between the start and the current time
total_time_fl = time.time() - start_time
print('Time using for loop: {} sec'.format(total_time_fl))

# B. Locate rows: .iloc[] vs .loc[]
# .iloc[] is great (more efficient) for searching by rows
# .loc[] is great for selecting features

# 1. Row selection comparison
# Define the range of rows to select: row_nums
row_nums = range(0, 1000)

# Select the rows using .loc[] and row_nums and record the time before and after
loc_start_time = time.time()
rows = poker_hands.loc[row_nums]
loc_end_time = time.time()

# Print the time it took to select the rows using .loc
print("Time using .loc[]: {} sec".format(loc_end_time - loc_start_time))

# Select the rows using .iloc[] and row_nums and record the time before and after
iloc_start_time = time.time()
rows = poker_hands.iloc[row_nums]
iloc_end_time = time.time()

# Print the time it took to select the rows using .iloc
print("Time using .iloc[]: {} sec".format(iloc_end_time - iloc_start_time))

# 2. Column selection comparison
# Use .iloc to select the first, fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth column and record the times before and after
iloc_start_time = time.time()
cols = poker_hands.iloc[:,[0,3,4,6,7]]
iloc_end_time = time.time()

# Print the time it took
print("Time using .iloc[] : {} sec".format(iloc_end_time - iloc_start_time))

# Use simple column selection to select the first, fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth column and record the times before and after
names_start_time = time.time()
cols = poker_hands[['S1', 'S2', 'R2', 'R3', 'S4']]
names_end_time = time.time()

# Print the time it took
print("Time using selection by name : {} sec".format(names_end_time - names_start_time))

# C. Select random rows
# 1. Random row selection
# The built in dataframe method was more efficient
# Extract number of rows in dataset
N=poker_hands.shape[0]

# Select and time the selection of the 75% of the dataset's rows
rand_start_time = time.time()
poker_hands.iloc[np.random.randint(low=0, high=N, size=int(0.75 * N))]
print("Time using Numpy: {} sec".format(time.time() - rand_start_time))

# Select and time the selection of the 75% of the dataset's rows using sample()
samp_start_time = time.time()
poker_hands.sample(int(0.75 * N), axis=0, replace = True)
print("Time using .sample: {} sec".format(time.time() - samp_start_time))

# 2. Random column selection
# Extract number of columns in dataset
D=poker_hands.shape[1]

# Select and time the selection of 4 of the dataset's columns using NumPy
np_start_time = time.time()
poker_hands.iloc[:,np.random.randint(low=0, high=D, size=4)]
print("Time using NymPy's random.randint(): {} sec".format(time.time() - np_start_time))

# Select and time the selection of 4 of the dataset's columns using pandas
pd_start_time = time.time()
poker_hands.sample(4, axis=1)
print("Time using panda's .sample(): {} sec".format(time.time() - pd_start_time))
