# Working with date time objects
# Start date for R is 1st January 1970

# Get the current date: today
today <- Sys.Date()

# See what today looks like under the hood
unclass(today)

# Get the current time: now
now <- Sys.time()

# See what now looks like under the hood
unclass(now)

# 1. Create and format dates
# %Y: 4-digit year (1982)
# %y: 2-digit year (82)
# %m: 2-digit month (01)
# %d: 2-digit day of the month (13)
# %A: weekday (Wednesday)
# %a: abbreviated weekday (Wed)
# %B: month (January)
# %b: abbreviated month (Jan)

# Definition of character strings representing dates
str1 <- "May 23, '96"
str2 <- "2012-03-15"
str3 <- "30/January/2006"

# Convert the strings to dates: date1, date2, date3 - as.Date(): create the date variable
date1 <- as.Date(str1, format = "%b %d, '%y")
date2 <- as.Date(str2, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
date3 <- as.Date(str3, format = "%d/%B/%Y")

# Convert dates to formatted strings - format(): convert dates to character strings
format(date1, "%A")
format(date2, "%d")
format(date3, "%b %Y")

# 2. Create and format times
# %H: hours as a decimal number (00-23)
# %I: hours as a decimal number (01-12)
# %M: minutes as a decimal number
# %S: seconds as a decimal number
# %T: shorthand notation for the typical format %H:%M:%S
# %p: AM/PM indicator
# ?strptime: query this for a full list of symbols

# Definition of character strings representing times
str1 <- "May 23, '96 hours:23 minutes:01 seconds:45"
str2 <- "2012-3-12 14:23:08"

# Convert the strings to POSIXct objects: time1, time2
time1 <- as.POSIXct(str1, format = "%B %d, '%y hours:%H minutes:%M seconds:%S")
time2 <- as.POSIXct(str2, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Convert times to formatted strings
format(time1, "%M")
format(time2, "%I:%M %p")

# 3. Calculations with Dates
# day1, day2, day3, day4 and day5 are already available in the workspace

# Difference between last and first pizza day
day5 - day1

# Create vector pizza
pizza <- c(day1, day2, day3, day4, day5)

# Create differences between consecutive pizza days: day_diff
day_diff <- diff(pizza)

# Average period between two consecutive pizza days
mean(day_diff)

# 4. Calculations with Times
# login and logout are already defined in the workspace
# Calculate the difference between login and logout: time_online
time_online <- logout - login

# Inspect the variable time_online
time_online

# Calculate the total time online
sum(time_online)

# Calculate the average time online
mean(time_online)
