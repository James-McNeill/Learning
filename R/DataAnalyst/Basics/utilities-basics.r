# Utilities - basics

# 1. Mathematical
# round: round the values to 0 decimal places by default

# The errors vector has already been defined for you
errors <- c(1.9, -2.6, 4.0, -9.5, -3.4, 7.3)

# Sum of absolute rounded values of errors
sum(abs(round(errors)))

# 2. Data
# seq(): Generate sequences, by specifying the from, to, and by arguments.
# rep(): Replicate elements of vectors and lists.
# sort(): Sort a vector in ascending order. Works on numerics, but also on character strings and logicals.
# rev(): Reverse the elements in a data structures for which reversal is defined.
# str(): Display the structure of any R object.
# append(): Merge vectors or lists.
# is.*(): Check for the class of an R object.
# as.*(): Convert an R object from one class to another.
# unlist(): Flatten (possibly embedded) lists to produce a vector.

# The linkedin and facebook lists have already been created for you
linkedin <- list(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook <- list(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)

# Convert linkedin and facebook to a vector: li_vec and fb_vec
li_vec <- unlist(linkedin)
fb_vec <- unlist(facebook)

# Append fb_vec to li_vec: social_vec
social_vec <- append(li_vec, fb_vec)

# Sort social_vec
rev(sort(social_vec))

# Fix me - had to switch the two functions into the correct order
rep(seq(1, 7, by = 2), times = 7)

# Create first sequence: seq1
seq1 <- seq(1, 500, by = 3)

# Create second sequence: seq2
seq2 <- seq(1200, 900, by = -7)

# Calculate total sum of the sequences
sum(append(seq1, seq2))
