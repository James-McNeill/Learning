# Create gapminder_1952

# 1. Produce scattergraph
# aes: relates to the axis
# geom_point(): added to signify that a geometric point layer is requested for the plot
# Change to put pop on the x-axis and gdpPercap on the y-axis
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point()

# 2. Add log scale to the axis
# scale_x_log10(): method converts the x axis variable to log base 10 scale. For y axis conversion just switch x with y
# Change this plot to put the x-axis on a log scale
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()

# Scatter plot comparing pop and gdpPercap, with both axes on a log scale
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10()

# 3. Additional aesthetics. color and size
# Scatter plot comparing pop and lifeExp, with color representing continent
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10()

# Add the size aesthetic to represent a country's gdpPercap
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()

# 4. Faceting, provides subgraph
# Scatter plot comparing pop and lifeExp, faceted by continent
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent)

# Scatter plot comparing gdpPercap and lifeExp, with color representing continent
# and size representing population, faceted by year
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10() +
    facet_wrap(~ year)
