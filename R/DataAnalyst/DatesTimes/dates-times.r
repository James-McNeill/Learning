# Working with Dates and Times

# A. Introduction to dates
# 1. Specifying dates.
# The date R 3.0.0 was released. This date format is referenced as ISO 8601 and is the recommended format to use (YYYY-MM-DD)
x <- "2013-04-03"

# Examine structure of x
str(x)

# Use as.Date() to interpret x as a date
x_date <- as.Date(x)

# Examine structure of x_date
str(x_date)

# Store April 10 2014 as a Date
april_10_2014 <- as.Date("2014-04-10")

# 2. Automatic import
# Load the readr package
library(readr)

# Use read_csv() to import rversions.csv
releases <- read_csv("rversions.csv")

# Examine the structure of the date column
str(releases$Date)

# Load the anytime package. Package has sole objective to automatically parse strings as dates regardless of format
library(anytime)

# Various ways of writing Sep 10 2009
sep_10_2009 <- c("September 10 2009", "2009-09-10", "10 Sep 2009", "09-10-2009")

# Use anytime() to parse sep_10_2009
anytime(sep_10_2009)

# B. Why use dates?
# 1. Plotting
library(ggplot2)

# Set the x axis to the date column
ggplot(releases, aes(x = date, y = type)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1, color = factor(major)))

# Limit the axis to between 2010-01-01 and 2014-01-01
ggplot(releases, aes(x = date, y = type)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1, color = factor(major))) +
  xlim(as.Date("2010-01-01"), as.Date("2014-01-01"))

# Specify breaks every ten years and labels with "%Y"
ggplot(releases, aes(x = date, y = type)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1, color = factor(major))) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "10 years", date_labels = "%Y")

# 2. Arithmetic and logical operators
# Since Date objects are internally represented as the number of days since 1970-01-01 you can do basic math and comparisons with dates.
# Find the largest date
last_release_date <- max(releases$date)

# Filter row for last release
last_release <- filter(releases, date == last_release_date)

# Print last_release
last_release

# How long since last release?
Sys.Date() - last_release_date
