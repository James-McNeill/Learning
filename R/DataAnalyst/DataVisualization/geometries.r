# Working with the different geometries

# A. Scatter plots
# 1. Overplotting 1: large datasets
# Plot price vs. carat, colored by clarity
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = clarity))

# Add a point layer with tiny points
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, shape = ".")

# Set transparency to 0.5. Remove line outlines by adjusting shape
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, shape = 16)

# 2. Overplotting 2: aligned values. Occurs when one axis is continuous and the other is categorical
# Plot base
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, mpg, color = fam))

# Default points are shown for comparison
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point()

# Alter the point positions by jittering, width 0.3
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point(position = position_jitter(0.3))

# Now jitter and dodge the point positions
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.3, dodge.width = 0.3))
