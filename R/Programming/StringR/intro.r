# Introduction to stringr

# A. Intro
# 1. Putting strings together with stringr
# For your first stringr function, we'll look at str_c(), the c is short for concatenate, a function that works like paste(). 
# It takes vectors of strings as input along with sep and collapse arguments.
library(stringr)

my_toppings <- c("cheese", NA, NA)
my_toppings_and <- paste(c("", "", "and "), my_toppings, sep = "")

# Print my_toppings_and
my_toppings_and

# Use str_c() instead of paste(): my_toppings_str
my_toppings_str <- str_c(c("", "", "and "), my_toppings)

# Print my_toppings_str
my_toppings_str

# paste() my_toppings_and with collapse = ", "
paste(my_toppings_and, collapse = ", ")

# str_c() my_toppings_str with collapse = ", "
str_c(my_toppings_str, collapse = ", ")

# another stringr function str_replace_na() can be used to replace missing values with any string choosen

# 2. String length
library(stringr)
library(babynames)
library(dplyr)

# Extracting vectors for boys' and girls' names
babynames_2014 <- filter(babynames, year == 2014)
boy_names <- filter(babynames_2014, sex == "M")$name
girl_names <- filter(babynames_2014, sex == "F")$name

# Take a look at a few boy_names
head(boy_names)

# Find the length of all boy_names
boy_length <- str_length(boy_names)

# Take a look at a few lengths
head(boy_length)

# Find the length of all girl_names
girl_length <- str_length(girl_names)

# Find the difference in mean length
mean(girl_length) - mean(boy_length)

# Confirm str_length() works with factors
head(str_length(factor(boy_names)))
