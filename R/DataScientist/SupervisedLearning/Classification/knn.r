# Classification with Nearnest Neighbor (k-NN)

# As the kNN algorithm literally "learns by example" it is a case in point for starting to understand supervised machine learning. 
# This chapter will introduce classification while working through the application of kNN to self-driving vehicle road sign recognition.

# Load the 'class' package
library(class)

# Create a vector of labels
sign_types <- signs$sign_type

# Classify the next sign observed
knn(train = signs[-1], test = next_sign, cl = sign_types) # next_sign holds the classification object

# Exploring the traffic sign dataset
# Examine the structure of the signs dataset
str(signs)

# Count the number of signs of each type
table(signs$sign_type)

# Check r10's average red level by sign type
aggregate(r10 ~ sign_type, data = signs, mean)

# Use kNN to identify the test road signs
sign_types <- signs$sign_type
signs_pred <- knn(train = signs[-1], test = test_signs[-1], cl = sign_types)

# Create a confusion matrix of the predicted versus actual values
signs_actual <- test_signs$sign_type
table(signs_pred, signs_actual)

# Compute the accuracy
mean(signs_pred == signs_actual)
