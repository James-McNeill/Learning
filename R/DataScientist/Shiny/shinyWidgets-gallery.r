# The shinyWidgets gallery

# Let's look at all the different input options that are already built for you by exploring the shinyWidgets package. 
# It comes with a neat built-in function, shinyWidgetsGallery() that opens a pre-built Shiny app that allows you to explore 
# these pre-built inputs and gives you the code for implementing them.

# Navigate to the radioButtons section. What argument do you use in radioGroupButtons() to display the buttons vertically instead of horizontally?
