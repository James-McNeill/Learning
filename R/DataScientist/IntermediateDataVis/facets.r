# Facets

# A. Facets layer
# 1. Basics
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  # Facet rows by am
  facet_grid(rows = vars(am))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  # Facet columns by cyl
  facet_grid(cols = vars(cyl))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  # Facet rows by am and columns by cyl
  facet_grid(rows = vars(am), cols = vars(cyl))

# 2. Many variables
# See the interaction column. Interaction is how the variables combined iteract with each other
mtcars$fcyl_fam

# Color the points by fcyl_fam
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = fcyl_fam)) +
  geom_point() +
  # Use a paired color palette
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")

# Update the plot. Final plot has seven variables from the original dataset included
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = fcyl_fam, size = disp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  # Grid facet on gear and vs
  facet_grid(rows = vars(gear), cols = vars(vs))

# 3. Formula notation. This is the previous formula convention to create the facet grid plots. Making use of the vars() method is now preferred
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  # Facet rows by am using formula notation
  facet_grid(am ~ .)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  # Facet columns by cyl using formula notation
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  # Facet rows by am and columns by cyl using formula notation
  facet_grid(am ~ cyl)
