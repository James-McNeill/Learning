# Intro to statistics

# Mean and median
food_consumption %>%
  # Filter for Belgium and USA
  filter(country %in% c("Belgium", "USA")) %>%
  # Group by country
  group_by(country) %>%
  # Get mean_consumption and median_consumption
  summarize(mean_consumption = mean(consumption),
      median_consumption = median(consumption))

# Mean vs median. Working with skewed data
food_consumption %>%
  # Filter for rice food category
  filter(food_category == "rice") %>%
  # Create histogram of co2_emission
  ggplot(aes(co2_emission)) +
    geom_histogram()

food_consumption %>%
  # Filter for rice food category
  filter(food_category == "rice") %>% 
  # Get mean_co2 and median_co2
  summarize(mean_co2 = mean(co2_emission),
            median_co2 = median(co2_emission))
