# stacking, chaining & piping

stacking csv files on top of each other. Able to add in additional variable to show the table source. Chaining 
allows commands to be chained together. Piping is the same as chaining but has more functionality.

# Stack the two files and save results as a new file
csvstack SpotifyData_PopularityRank6.csv SpotifyData_PopularityRank7.csv > SpotifyPopularity.csv

# If csvlook succeeds, then run csvstat 
csvlook Spotify_Popularity.csv && csvstat Spotify_Popularity.csv

# Use the output of csvsort as input to csvlook
csvsort -c 2 Spotify_Popularity.csv | csvlook

# Take top 15 rows from sorted output and save to new file
csvsort -c 2 Spotify_Popularity.csv | head -n 15 > Spotify_Popularity_Top15.csv

# Preview the new file 
csvlook Spotify_Popularity_Top15.csv

# While stacking the 2 files, create a data source column
csvstack -g "Sep2018","Oct2018" Spotify201809_subset.csv Spotify201810_subset.csv > Spotify_all_rankings.csv
