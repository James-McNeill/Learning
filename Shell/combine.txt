# Combining Tools

The real power of the Unix shell lies not in the individual commands, but in how easily they can be combined to do new things. 
This chapter will show you how to use this power to select the data you want, and introduce commands for sorting values and removing duplicates.

> : apply a redirection to create an output file
| : pipe, allows for multiple actions to be combined together without having to store multiple temporary files before final processing
wc : word count, prints number of characters, words and lines in a file (-c, -w, -l)
* : wildcard, can be used match zero or more characters. Allows for selecting all files within a location. Makes sure that no 
  files are missed. ? : matches single character, [..] matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets, {..} matches any of the comma-separated patterns
sort : puts data in order. -n : used for numeric, -r : reverse the order, -b : ignore leading blanks and -f : fold case (i.e. be case-sensitive)
uniq : remove duplicated lines, removes adjacent duplicated lines. -c : display unique lines with a count
ctrl + c : stops a script running
