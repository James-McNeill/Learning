# Batch Processing

Most shell commands will process many files at once. This chapter shows you how to make your own pipelines do that. 
Along the way, you will see how the shell uses variables to store information.

echo : print statement. Having a $ before name shows the variable value
shell variable : local variable in programming languages (training=seasonal/winter.csv) training will have the variable value of seasonal/winter.csv
for filetype in gif jpg png; do echo $filetype; done : shows for looping
> datasets=seasonal/*.csv
> for filename in $datasets; do echo $filename; done
# displays the filenames from the wildcard variable created
