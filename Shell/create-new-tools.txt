# Creating new tools

History lets you repeat things with just a few keystrokes, and pipes let you combine existing commands to create new ones. 
In this chapter, you will see how to go one step further and create new commands of your own.

nano : one of the many text editors that can be used
nano filename : creates a new file in the editor. 
  ctrl + k : delete a line, 
  ctrl + u : un-delete a line, 
  ctrl + o : output file, 
  ctrl + x : exit editor
bash headers.sh : bash command runs the list of commands contained within the headers.sh file. nano headers.sh is used to create the file
$@ : within the text file (file.sh as example) means "all of the command-line parameters given to a scipt". So this allows for any number 
  of file names to be passed, instead of having this explicitly within the text file
